You know that this selection is appropriate and that it will appeal to your customers.&nbsp;Or you could even use your best-sellers, by adding them to those that are less visible, to allow your customers to discover them.&nbsp;Your packs will need to be made up of 2 products minimum, the number is unlimited.Push the quantity per product, choose the combinations of your choice, there are multiple options allowing you to multiply the possibilities.&nbsp;Would you like to reserve the purchase of a product within a pack?That is also possible! You will therefore be able&nbsp;to offer a free product&nbsp;if it is purchased as part of a pack. The possibilities are infinite!&nbsp;Integrated assistant&nbsp;It isn&#39;t always obvious deciding which products should be offered within a pack. Here again&nbsp;Advanced Pack&nbsp;has the solution to the problem.When creating your pack, our module will supply you with strategic information, like the number of products sold or their available stock.&nbsp;There is also an integrated&nbsp;dynamic price simulator&nbsp;for your pack, to help you see more clearly when creating your business operation.&nbsp;Remain the maestro of combinations&nbsp;One of the products that you have added to your pack is available in several colors, but you don&#39;t want to offer them all in this set?Advanced Pack&nbsp;will allow you to do this.&nbsp;You will also have the possibility of predefining a combination by default, for each of the products of your pack, even if it&#39;s different to the one defined in your catalog.&nbsp;Your customers will then be able to&nbsp;personalise their selection&nbsp;amongst the characteristics that you will have chosen to integrate in the offer.&nbsp;Business Incentive&nbsp;Incentive is something that motivates your visitor to make a purchase The main aim is to convince more of your site visitors to finish their order and/or&nbsp;spend more money per transaction.Perhaps you have already tried, by offering free delivery over a certain amount of purchases, or to offer discounts on certain products or even to send discount vouchers?All of these methods work, but their range is limited, as these promotions are usually temporary due to their excessive cost!Stop looking, you have already found the solution !&nbsp;To entice your customers,&nbsp;Advanced Pack&nbsp;will give you the choice of applying a discount when all the products in the shopping cart are ordered, thus encouraging the purchase of the whole pack.&nbsp;3 possibilities are available:&nbsp;Offer a specific discount on&nbsp;each product&nbsp;in the packApply a general discount on&nbsp;the set of productsApply a&nbsp;fixed price, such as a psychological price, for example&nbsp;Advanced Pack&nbsp;will also be able to manage the discounts already applied to your products, allowing you to integrate them in the pack price, or on the contrary, to exclude them, in order to choose the predefined discount on the pack.This decision will be made even easier thanks to our&nbsp;clear and clean-looking interface, that will allow you to see the discounted products very easily.&nbsp;You won&#39;t need to worry about the coherence of your prices anymore&nbsp;Have you ever had to review all the prices in your catalog, to detect any possible incoherences and correct them? What would happen if you had to manually manage the repercussions of these changes in product pricing in your packs? This would represent a significant extra workload if if it&#39;s not anticipated within the choice of management solutions within your packs!&nbsp;Once again&nbsp;Advanced Pack&nbsp;has the solution.&nbsp;By default, in the case where no reduction has been applied, the pack price is the sum of the products making it up.Should you need to modify the price of a product after having created the pack,&nbsp;the pack price will automatically be updated, and without you having to intervene.&nbsp;In those cases where you will apply a discount to one or more products in an existing pack, and on condition you have authorized the&nbsp;promotional implications, the pack price will also be changed, showing your customers the discount that has been applied.&nbsp;Is one of the products of your pack subject to an green-tax? No problem, it will automatically be reflected in the pack price and will be clearly stated, guaranteeing absolute&nbsp;respect for the legislation.&nbsp;Regarding the management of your stock, everything has been automated!&nbsp;For each pack ordered, the product stocks it contains will be&nbsp;automatically deducted. This way you will avoid the double management of stock or the frustration generated by sales rendered impossible, due to the bad assignation of quantities.Also, in the case where a product in a pack is out of stock, it will&nbsp;automatically be displayed as unavailable&nbsp;for purchase thanks to an availability warning system that is both elegant and modern.&nbsp;For your customers, we have integrated a graphic and fun notification system, allowing the instant identification of stock shortages on combinations or products making up the pack.&nbsp;There&#39;s no chance of you receiving orders for products that are out of stock !&nbsp;Highlight your packs and sell more&nbsp;Once you have defined your pack, you will be able to configure it in the same way as you would a classic product. Everything is possible, such as assigning it customized images, classing it in the category of your choice,&nbsp;optimizing your SEO, writing a customized description, attributing it an EAN code or a specific reference, configuring its volume to calculate delivery costs, etc...&nbsp;For those that are pressed for time, and in order to facilitate their marketing,&nbsp;Advanced Pack&nbsp;will automatically display all the photos of the products that make it up, as well as their descriptions, in the form of tabs.Your customers will be correctly informed, without leaving the page of your pack, and&nbsp;able to finalise their purchase in one click.&nbsp;And that&#39;s not all... For more visibility, your packs will automatically be&nbsp;highlighted on their data sheets&nbsp;for those being sold in lotsThis way, you will encourage your customers to order the pack, rather than the product they were initially interested in. Essentially, this is&nbsp;cross-selling: an accessible method of&nbsp;increasing your average shopping cart&nbsp;!&nbsp;We don&#39;t forget designers&nbsp;From the beginning, we have integrated the fact that this module should be easily adapted by your web agency or designer/integrator.The module adapts itself perfectly to the default PrestaShop 1.6 and 1.7 themes, whilst allowing the most advanced graphic personalization.&nbsp;A set of JavaScript templates and CSS style sheets are delivered as models with the module,&nbsp;to facilitate the integration process. Either yourself or your integrator will therefore be able to use all of the functionalities of the&nbsp;Advanced Pack 5&nbsp;engine, in order to present them in the graphic form that will best correspond with the general atmosphere of your online store.]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[merchandizing]]></tab><version><![CDATA[5.2.13]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.1.0]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.7.5]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[299.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[369.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[259.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/616235-pprod/advanced-pack-5-create-bundles-of-products.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/616235-pbig/advanced-pack-5-create-bundles-of-products.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[1048]]></id><name><![CDATA[facebookpsshoptab]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Advanced Shop for Fan Page]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Products on Facebook & Social Networks]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Create a multilingual, multicurrency and completely customized Facebook shop.

It allows you to display your products in sale on your site directly on the most popular social network. Then, you make the most of your Facebook community to boost the traffic on your PrestaShop site. Contrary to the native shop tab, that has many constraints, the "Advanced Shop for Fan Page" module allows you to: create a completely customized Facebook shop, whether in terms of design, menu type or displaycreate a multilingual and multicurrency shopnot need to submit your products to Facebook for review in order to make them visible for the publicmake the PrestaShop website's modifications instantly visible on the Facebook shop (changes of price, product image,...)display featured categories on the home pagedisplay on Facebook the average rating of each product/category, given on your site (with the shape of stars) if you also have installed on your Prestashop our product rating "Customer Ratings and Reviews Pro + Google Rich Snippets" module (available here: https://addons.prestashop.com/en/seo-natural-search-engine-optimization/6144-customer-ratings-and-reviews-pro-google-rich-snippets.html)  Notes: (x) 1/ So that real-time harmonization between Facebook and your online store is possible, the module has to create a new custom "shop" tab, independent of the default "shop" tab already installed by Facebook on your page. 2/ if you want to create Facebook catalogs and tag your products on Facebook and Instagram, you should choose our "Dynamic Ads + Pixel" module instead, that is available here: https://addons.prestashop.com/en/remarketing-shopping-cart-abandonment/23671-dynamic-ads-pixel.html. 3/ Facebook mobile app does not allow custom tabs insertion, like the one created by our module. Therefore, this latter can only be displayed on the Facebook web version. If you want to see your Facebook shop on mobile, you have to choose our "Dynamic Ads + Pixel" module (available here: https://addons.prestashop.com/en/remarketing-shopping-cart-abandonment/23671-dynamic-ads-pixel.html) in order to import your products into the native Facebook shop tab (however you will not be able to customize the shop).  To know more about the difference between the Facebook native shop tab (and filled by our "Dynamic Ads + Pixel" module) and the custom tab set by our "Advanced Shop for Fan Page" module, read our detailed comparison at this address: https://faq.businesstech.fr/en/faq/230  ]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[social_networks]]></tab><version><![CDATA[5.2.7]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.0.4]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.7.5]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[79.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[99.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[69.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/963149-pprod/advanced-shop-for-fan-page.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/963149-pbig/advanced-shop-for-fan-page.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[1768]]></id><name><![CDATA[gmerchantcenter]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Google Merchant Center (Google-Shopping)]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Price Comparison]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Export your products on Google Merchant Center to display them on Google Shopping, Google Search, Google Image, the Display network (YouTube, Gmail,…) and Google partner sites!

Make yourself known internationally in an accelerated way and get thousands of new highly qualified visitors to your shop.   With over a decade of success, our&nbsp;Google Merchant Center (Google Shopping)&nbsp;module is by far the most robust and complete Google Shopping module on the market.

We have included, throughout the configuration,&nbsp;links to a precise and complete documentation&nbsp;based on&nbsp;Google's official regulations. You quickly get a clear product data file that you can export to Google Merchant Center and which you can schedule to be updated automatically at the desired frequency.   New from Google: with a quality product data feed, you now have the ability to display&nbsp;for free&nbsp;your products on Google Shopping, and other compatible Google properties, in "free product listings".

In addition, you can choose the character to be displayed between the values of the same feature. If you also use our "Advanced Search 4" filters module (available here: https://addons.prestashop.com/en/search-filters/2778-advanced-search-4-filters-search.html), you further increase the search relevance in your catalog. Our module is also compatible with the PrestaShop faceted search (block layered) native module.  Import your features and their multiple values in bulk action! Use the PrestaShop native CSV import tool to assign in bulk, and in a specific order, feature values to your products. In your "Products" CSV import file, use the "Feature(Name:Value:Position)" column to define for each feature the values to be assigned to each product. Indicate in the module configuration the character used to separate the different values and that's it! Example: Separator used: |Material:Yellow gold|White gold,Type of gemstone:Diamond This product will therefore be assigned 2 values of the feature "Material", and a single value of the feature "Type of gemstone".]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[search_filter]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.5.5]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.0.4]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.7.5]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[49.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[64.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[44.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://medias3.prestastore.com/1367793-pprod/multiple-features-assign-your-features-without-limit.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://medias3.prestastore.com/1367793-pbig/multiple-features-assign-your-features-without-limit.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[6946]]></id><name><![CDATA[invoicepayment]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Invoice Payment ]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Payment by Invoice]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[The payment by invoice is very popular in many countries, especially among German and Swiss customersWith this module, you can offer the invoice payment method to your registered customers in order to]]></description><author><![CDATA[Silbersaiten]]></author><url><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/en/payment-invoice/6946-invoice-payment.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><img><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/img/pico/6946.jpg]]></img><description_full><![CDATA[The payment by invoice is very popular in many countries, especially among German and Swiss customersWith this module, you can offer the invoice payment method to your registered customers in order to provide a safe shopping experience.]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[With this module, you can offer a bill payment to your users.

Our Cookies module complies with the Right of Rectification, with it users can delete the cookies installed from the site simply by accessing a url or even from their own customer profile. Obtaining consentThe user has to click on the “I accept” button in the warning banner to give his consent. As soon as the client gives his consent, the warning banner disappears and all the modules that use cookies will be activated and will work as usual. The user can configure the type of cookies to which he or she wants to give consent by clicking on the ‘Manage Cookies’ button and selecting which cookies he or she wants to activate or not.Blocking CookiesThe module allows the blocking of cookies until the user gives his consent. Cookies can be functional (mandatory) or from third parties. They allow the user to give his or her consent separately. This complies with the law as it differentiates the different types of cookies that the client accepts.Functional (mandatory) cookies: includes the key cookies for the operation of the website. For example, save the login data, the shopping cart, etc.Third-party cookies: includes cookies that collect data for tracking, segmentation, analysis, etc.In order to comply with the directives of the LSSI, we recommend that you deactivate the tracking modules (such as Google Analytics), social network modules (Facebook’s “Like” button, Google’s “+1” button, etc.) and targeted advertising.

The module includes a Wysiwyg editor that allows you to fully customize the content of the banner (font, color, effects, html code …). You can also choose from the configuration page the background color of the banner, its opacity percentage (transparency) and its position (above or below the screen). In addition, the module is multi-language and automatically detects all the languages of your store, which allows you to write a different message per language.Information: we have developed the module so that it does not appear when search engine robots crawl your website and that it does not affect your SEO. Block screen until cookies are acceptedTo help the online shop lose as little information as possible it has an option that does not allow the customer to browse until they accept the cookie policy, i.e. it blocks the screen until the user accepts the cookies. Notice in the form of a pop upThe module displays a pop up to inform your customers about the use of cookies and ask for their consent for their installation. Multi-store modeThe module is compatible with multi-store mode and allows you to put the same warning banner in each of your stores, but the consent is the same for all your stores. If you accept cookies for one of your stores, the module will consider that you have accepted cookies for all your stores (indicate this in the Cookies Policy) and the warning banner will not appear later in the other stores.]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[administration]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.4.27]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.5.0.0]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.7.5]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[49.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[64.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[44.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/1478625-pprod/eu-cookie-law-gdpr-banner-blocker-update-2021.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/1478625-pbig/eu-cookie-law-gdpr-banner-blocker-update-2021.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[8741]]></id><name><![CDATA[dmulistecommandes]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[DMU Improved Order List]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Order Management]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Save time on the processing of your orders!

The “Free Delivery Manager” module is actually the perfect solution for offering your respected customers free shipping through objective rules. It is the promise of a rise in the amount of orders with total control of delivery costs.  The module allows you to calculate in advance, with the help of precise rules, the necessary conditions for unlocking free delivery. The management and monitoring are done according to carriers, delivery area, price, weight, or any other criteria you term as important for your business.  The “Free Delivery Manager” module offers control of delivery costs by releasing delivery available as a function of criteria you have chosen. All the carriers have their own price list. You may, for example, indicate a minimum order amount by carrier In presenting to the customer, in their order summary, the amount remaining before delivery is available, so you definitely encourage them to order more.  Highly detailed statistics visually present two types of reports together. The first one presents the number of orders that have benefited from free delivery, as well as the total and per-order amount that this cost you. You really control the impact of delivery costs. The second report displays the detail of costs caused by free postage and the orders where the rules for free shipping are applied. Thus, the “Free Delivery Manager” module increases the value of transactions as well as the number of orders!  This module has been constantly evolving, many thanks to user feedback. TimActive, in fact, grants great importance to your perception of our solutions and of the improvements that can be added. ]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[shipping_logistics]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.6.21]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.5.0.0]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.7.5]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[89.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[109.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[79.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="PrestaShop&#39;s Favorite"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/ps-selected.png]]></badge><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://medias3.prestastore.com/691962-pprod/free-delivery-manager.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://medias3.prestastore.com/691962-pbig/free-delivery-manager.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[8934]]></id><name><![CDATA[migrationpro]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[MigrationPro: PrestaShop Upgrade and Migrate Tool]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Data migration & Backup]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Upgrade PrestaShop 1.4, 1.5 or 1.6 to PrestaShop 1.7]]></description><author><![CDATA[MigrationPro]]></author><url><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/en/data-migration-backup/8934-migrationpro-prestashop-upgrade-and-migrate-tool.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><img><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/img/pico/8934.jpg]]></img><description_full><![CDATA[Upgrade PrestaShop 1.4, 1.5 or 1.6 to PrestaShop 1.7.x for an instant!

"Buy on Google" is Google's new program that allows you to sell your products directly on Google, providing your customers with an extremely simplified shopping experience through one-click login and payment. Thanks to our module, you don't need to log in to your Merchant Center account to be able to process orders placed through this channel: they are automatically synchronized in your PrestaShop back office so that you can process them like any order placed on your site. The different order statuses are automatically updated in real time in your Google Merchant Center account. Service currently only available in France and in the USA, registration subject to validation, requires a monthly subscription EVEN MORE DATA CONTROL WITH THIS PROFESSIONAL VERSION With more than a decade of success, the standard version of our Google Merchant Center (Google Shopping) module is by far&nbsp;the most robust and complete&nbsp;Google Shopping module on the market. This&nbsp;professional&nbsp;version goes even further with&nbsp;exclusive&nbsp;features such as the ability to create precise product exclusion rules, to manage&nbsp;advanced&nbsp;custom labels, or to export your promotions and product reviews(*). GO EVEN FURTHER IN OPTIMIZING THE DISTRIBUTION OF YOUR ADS In addition to the multiple possibilities of configuring your feed that the standard version of the module already offers, you will be able to refine the choice of products or product combinations to be exported thanks to the setting up of extremely precise and personalized exclusion rules. Thanks to the advanced assignation of custom labels, you will also have the ability to segment your product catalog and therefore organize your ads according to the seasonality of your products, their popularity, or the margin you can apply to them. This allows you to control your budget by offering the right products at the right time and optimize your return on investment. In Shopping ads, the display of stars reflecting the rating of items undoubtedly gives more attractiveness to products.

Pop Newsletter creates a popup inviting your visitors to sign up for your newsletter.

Turn your visitors into subscribers! &nbsp; Improve the subscription rate for your shop:  Pop-ins are effective at attracting visitors&rsquo; attention, gaining more clicks than sliders, banners or sign-up panels in the footer (which have a conversion rate of only 0.05%). The proven results for this tool show increases of between 20% and 1,000% in your subscription rate. &nbsp; Turn your subscribers into loyal customers: Offer them a discount voucher for their next purchase in your shop to thank them for subscribing. &nbsp; Offer a flawless user experience: Similar to pop-ups but with an improved user experience, pop-ins integrate perfectly with the page where they appear. Pop Newsletter applies best practices recommended for this advertising method:Lightbox effectOption to close the module window with a simple click outside the pop-in, as well as a cross symbol button for closure in the top right-hand corner.Option to specify when the pop-in is activated. This allows your visitor to get to know your site before seeing the pop-in.Once your visitor closes the pop-in, it will not be shown again.Adaptable to all types of shop, with no need for programming or graphic design skills.&nbsp; &nbsp; Improve results from your newsletters by increasing your contact base: Thanks to the optional newsletter sign-up form, you can analyse and classify your subscribers more effectively. Pop Newsletter also allows you to send a confirmation e-mail to the e-mail address provided by your subscriber to ensure there is no chance of your newsletter being sent to an incorrect address.]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[front_office_features]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.6.0]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.0.4]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.7.2]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[59.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[74.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[54.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Made by PrestaShop"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/made-by-prestashop.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/722395-pprod/newsletter-popup.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/722395-pbig/newsletter-popup.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[21318]]></id><name><![CDATA[magicredirect]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Redirections URL (301 / Auto-fixing / Multishop / SEO)]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[URL & Redirects]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Predicts and automatically fix missing pages !

When a new customer wants to place an order on your shop, you have to ask them for their delivery and invoicing address. Your customers find this compulsory and repetitive step annoying and frustrating. Some customers give up and go to another site where they know they have already entered all their information. What is more, shipping errors caused by customers entering their addresses incorrectly are not uncommon, entailing additional transport costs and decreased customer satisfaction owing to the delays caused by their parcels being sent out and returned again. Easy Places is the ultimate solution for avoiding such problems!It allows you to offer your clients an elegant, high performance technical solution to make your account creation forms more pleasant to fill in.

The advanced assignment of custom labels to your products further increases the customization of your data feed and allows you to increase the segmentation possibilities of your catalog.&nbsp;Product feeds generated and imported in the Facebook Business Manager will allow you:&nbsp;to automatically supply and keep updated&nbsp;the shop section of your Facebook pageto diffuse&nbsp;product ads&nbsp;on Facebook and Instagram for very targeted audiencesto identify your products&nbsp;in your Facebook and Instagram publications or stories&nbsp;&nbsp;TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE WORLD&#39;S MOST ADVANCED ADVERTISING TECHNOLOGY&nbsp;Thanks to countless personal information collected on its network, each more accurate than the others, Facebook has&nbsp;a powerful advertising targeting tool&nbsp;on which Google can not compete. On the Business Manager interface you have a multitude of options allowing you to create your advertising audiences according to age, sex, family situation, geographical location, interests, groups, liked pages and any other information that Facebook has about its users.&nbsp;By installing a tracking tag (Facebook pixel) on your site pages, our module allows you to&nbsp;further&nbsp;enhance these audiences. Indeed, this pixel allows you to create audiences based on&nbsp;your visitor activity (purchases, products seen, carts,...).&nbsp;It also allows you to enjoy the indisputable efficiency of&nbsp;dynamic retargeting. Thus, you can for example to launch ad campaigns that will automatically display to Facebook users, the products they previously viewed on your site, or relevant product recommandations. Business Manager tools will then allow you to analyse the efficiency of these ads (conversion tracking).&nbsp;The power of Facebook also allows you&nbsp;to acquire new customers&nbsp;by attracting people whose interests are close to your current customers. Indeed, the personal information of the social network users, own by Facebook, is compared to the one of your existing customers. You can therefore display your products to these audiences, which are similar to your clientele.&nbsp;Last but not least,&nbsp;the cost&nbsp;is also typically&nbsp;lower&nbsp;than Google&#39;s!]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[social_networks]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.3.18]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.0.4]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.7.5]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[99.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[124.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[89.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Conversion: Agencies&#39; choice"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/awards-convert-agency.png]]></badge><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/1412117-pprod/facebook-dynamic-ads-pixel-shops.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/1412117-pbig/facebook-dynamic-ads-pixel-shops.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[24239]]></id><name><![CDATA[facebookproductsfeed]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Products Feed: Dynamic Ads & Shop & Tagging]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[SEA SEM (paid advertising) & Affiliation Platforms]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Creates a Product Catalogue to use with Facebook & Instagram]]></description><author><![CDATA[Smart Modules]]></author><url><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/en/sea-paid-advertising-affiliation-platforms/24239-products-feed-dynamic-ads-shop-tagging.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><img><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/img/pico/24239.jpg]]></img><description_full><![CDATA[Creates a Product Catalogue to use with Facebook & Instagram.  Create Product Ads, use Instagram product tagging feature, display your products on your Facebook page, be ready for the Dynamic Ads*]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[With this easy-to-configure module you will be able to export your products and later import it to Facebook to create a Product Catalogue. The catalogue created can be multilingual and have different prices and currencies for each country, all of this in a single catalogue With the Facebook Catalogue you can do several things:Product Ads: Create ads using your Product CatalogueInstagram Product Tagging: Shop the look.

You will also be able to give your customers the possibility to pre-pay their subscription for a certain period, in exchange, for example, for a discount. This module automatically installs for you, all the necessary mechanics to manage your subscriptions. Its extremely flexible operation allows you to define your own rules thanks to a series of relevant options. As for your customers, they enjoy a space allowing them to freely manage their subscriptions, directly through their account. OPT FOR THE MOST ATTRACTIVE BUSINESS MODEL OF THE MOMENT! Subscriptions are becoming an increasingly important part of our consumption habits. Peace of mind, saving time and money, the advantages are numerous and in 2019, 85% of European consumers took out at least 1 subscription. As a merchant, offering a subscription to your products ensures you recurring revenues and allows you to anticipate needs, reduce losses and therefore have a better cost management. In addition, because of the automatic renewal of orders, the subscription facilitates the loyalty of your customers. RELY ON A ROBUST AND FLEXIBLE MODULE Thanks to "Advanced Subscription" you can easily integrate the subscription into your business model. Once the module is installed, a multitude of options help you create your own rules for managing recurring orders. Among other things, you can give your customers more or less freedom, for example by allowing them to choose their renewal date or by imposing it according to your logistical constraints. Subscription sales are managed independently for each of the products in your catalog, so you can offer the subscription for some products and not others, or even sell a product on subscription only. OFFER PRE-PAYMENT AND SIMPLIFY YOUR INVENTORY MANAGEMENT The module gives you the possibility to activate the pre-payment of subscriptions. This allows you to ensure the payment of orders for a certain period of time and to have a better control of the stock of products. In order to encourage your customers to pay in advance, you will be able to offer them different types of discounts! NO NEED TO INSTALL PAYMENT MODULES, "ADVANCED SUBSCRIPTION" INTEGRATES THEM FOR YOU The module comes with a list of payment modules already integrated, including the Stripe and PayPlug modules allowing the automatic renewal of payments (minimum "Pro" offer required for PayPlug). You will just have to enter your merchant account IDs (see information and pricing on https://stripe.com/fr/ and https://www.payplug.com/fr/) and the payment methods will be automatically installed on your site.

The biggest difference between dropshipping and the standard retail  model is that the selling merchant doesn’t stock or own inventory.  Instead, the merchant purchases inventory as needed from a third party   to fulfill orders.

Not only to solve the task of putting the right product in front of the right customer, but also to improve the store navigation for customers browsing things they are, or could be, interested in. Recommendations help you drive revenue through cross-selling and up-selling, but it also drives revenue by increasing the customer experience on your site. Our recommendations drive an increase in revenue that is often noticeable within a few weeks, along with increase in engagement and time spent on store.&nbsp;Why using a recommendation engine?The most essential task of a recommender system is to serve up relevant content to the user at the right time. A product recommendation engine provide relevant products to store visitors to increase the likelihood of turning the visitor into a customer. Much like Netflix&#39;s recommender system aims to increase time spent at Netflix by serving up movies and series that the user is likely to want to watch.&nbsp;It is hard to serve the right product to the right visitor, at the right time. Doing this through featured products or featured categories is often as close to getting it &quot;right&quot; a store owner can get without spending a lot of time on maintaining the &quot;you may also like&quot; section for every product in store. This is impractical and the recommendation engine simply offers a better way of doing it. The algorithm analyses data on customers purchasing patterns and order history to derive the products a visitor is most likely to buy and putting them right in front of them, in real-time. Across all products in the assortment, served every hour, every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;An Engage account is required and additional fees may apply.&nbsp;Monthly plans start at $7 /mo and include 7 days free trial (no credit card required).Get more information about our pricing here: engage.zubi.ai&nbsp;]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[merchandizing]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.0.2]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.1.0]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.7.5]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[0]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[0]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[0]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Official Partner"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/ps-official-partner.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/1422277-pprod/product-recommendations-by-engage.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/1422277-pbig/product-recommendations-by-engage.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[49266]]></id><name><![CDATA[bdroppy]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[BDroppy- The best brands for your dropshipping business]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Marketplace & Affiliation Platforms]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Import thousands of top branded products into your store in just a few clicks and manage your entire business in dropshipping with a single dashboard]]></description><author><![CDATA[PrestaShop Partners]]></author><url><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/en/marketplace-prestashop-modules/49266-bdroppy-the-best-brands-for-your-dropshipping-business.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><img><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/img/pico/49266.jpg]]></img><description_full><![CDATA[Import thousands of top branded products into your store in just a few clicks and manage your entire business in dropshipping with a single dashboard.
